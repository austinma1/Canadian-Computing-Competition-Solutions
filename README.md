# Canadian-Computing-Competition-Solutions
Info

These are solutions written by me for the Canadian Computing Competition. Python3 is language being used to write all the solutions. All of the years cover the Junior division solutions of the CCC contest.

Contribute

If you would like to contribute, such as submitting a solution to a CCC question (Junior or Senior), please submit a pull request. However for the pull request to be accepted, I prefer the language to either be Python 3 and it has to pass on the official CCC grader and/or the DMOJ judge. If you have found a concern with any file at all, please leave an issue.
